	abstract = {The sulphur surface sites of pristine marcasite surfaces and their reactivity during initial air oxidation were investigated for the first time using synchrotron radiation excited photoelectron spectroscopy (SRXPS). Both S 2p and Fe 2p spectra were collected and compared to those of the polymorph pyrite. A new sulphur surface component is found additionally to the two known pyrite surface signals. Due to the non-isotropic character of the orthorhombic marcasite structure, its peak intensity depends strongly on the surface orientation. Its binding energy is close to the region of short-chained polysulphides. The signal is assigned to sulphur trimers produced by electron transfer between surface near sulphur dimers and S− formed after ruptures of SS bonds which results in S2− and S32−. In the cubic crystal arrangement of pyrite the stabilisation of S− to S2− is realised by an electron transfer from iron to sulphur only. A confirmation of this assumption is found in the Fe 2p spectra. The contribution of Fe3+ species — a result of the electron transfer process — is considerably less pronounced for marcasite. The mechanism of initial oxidation is different for marcasite and pyrite. The sulphur species responsible for the new spectroscopic component are the most reactive sites at the marcasite surface, while S2− is oxidised first in case of pyrite. The signals indicating the products of marcasite oxidation in the S 2p spectrum are less intense as expected from the intensity decreasing of the trimer peak. Therefore, an oxidation of sulphur trimers to elemental sulphur is assumed which could not be detected because of its volatility in the vacuum of the air lock system.},

Our previous paper [M.C. Biesinger et al., Appl. Surf. Sci. 257 (2010) 887–898.] in which we examined Sc, Ti, V, Cu and Zn species, has shown that all the values of the spectral fitting parameters for each specific species, i.e. binding energy (eV), full wide at half maximum (FWHM) value (eV) for each pass energy, spin–orbit splitting values and asymmetric peak shape fitting parameters, are not all normally provided in the literature and data bases, and are necessary for reproducible, quantitative chemical state analysis. A more consistent, practical and effective approach to curve fitting was developed based on a combination of (1) standard spectra from quality reference samples, (2) a survey of appropriate literature databases and/or a compilation of literature references and (3) specific literature references where fitting procedures are available. This paper extends this approach to the chemical states of Cr, Mn, Fe, Co and Ni metals, and various oxides and hydroxides where intense, complex multiplet splitting in many of the chemical states of these elements poses unique difficulties for chemical state analysis. The curve fitting procedures proposed use the same criteria as proposed previously but with the additional complexity of fitting of multiplet split spectra which has been done based on spectra of numerous reference materials and theoretical XPS modeling of these transition metal species. Binding energies, FWHM values, asymmetric peak shape fitting parameters, multiplet peak separation and peak area percentages are presented. The procedures developed can be utilized to remove uncertainties in the analysis of surface states in nano-particles, corrosion, catalysis and surface-engineered materials.},

The effect of concentration on the first-shell structure of Ni(II) in aqueous NiCl2 and NiCl2-MgCl2 solutions was investigated by Ni K edge X-ray absorption (XAS) and UV-Vis spectroscopy at ambient conditions. Both techniques show that no large structural change (e.g., transition from octahedral to tetrahedral-like configuration) occurs. Both methods confirm that the Ni(II) aqua ion (with six coordinated water molecules at RNi-O = 2.07(2) Å) is the dominant species over the whole NiCl2 concentration range. However, XANES, EXAFS and UV-Vis data show subtle changes at high salinity ({\textgreater} 2 molÁkg-1 NiCl2), which are consistent with the formation of small amounts of the NiCl+ complex (up to 0.44(23) Cl at a Ni-Cl distance of 2.35(2) Å in 5.05 molÁkg-1 NiCl2) in the pure NiCl2 solutions. At high Cl:Ni ratio in the NiCl2-MgCl2-H2O solutions, small amounts of [NiCl2]0 are also present. We developed a speciation-based mixed-solvent electrolyte (MSE) model to describe activity-composition relationships in NiCl2-MgCl2-H2O solutions, and at the same time predict Ni(II) speciation that is consistent with our XAS and UV-Vis data and with existing literature data up to the solubility limit, resolving a long-standing uncertainty about the role of chloride complexing in this system.},

	abstract = {Although the fundamental, theoretical peak shape in X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is Lorentzian, some Gaussian character is observed in most XPS signals. Additional complexity in the form of asymmetry is also found in many XPS signals, which requires more advanced peak shapes than the traditional, symmetric Voigt and Gaussian-Lorentzian sum and product (pseudo-Voigt) functions. Here, we discuss the merits and disadvantages of four approaches that have been used to introduce asymmetry into XPS peak shapes: addition of a decaying exponential tail to a symmetric peak shape, the Doniach-Sunjic peak shape, the double-Lorentzian, DL, function, and the LX peak shapes, which include the asymmetric Lorentzian (LA), finite Lorentzian (LF), and square Lorentzian (LS) functions. The Doniach-Sunjic peak shape is the only asymmetric, synthetic peak that has a theoretical basis. However, it has an infinite integral, which makes it problematic in quantitative work. The mathematical bases for the LX and DL peak shapes are discussed, and practical examples of their use in peak fitting are presented. The case is made for the Voigt function being the most appropriate function for XPS peak fitting, in general, which suggests that a modified Voigt function may be the most reasonable for fitting asymmetric XPS signals. The LX and DL functions include convolution with a Guassian, which, with the exception of the LS function, makes them Voigt-like functions. The sources of asymmetry and its complexity are discussed. It is emphasized that not every asymmetric spectrum should be fit with an asymmetric peak shape.},

The multiplets were found to fit most spectra well, particularly when contributions attributed to surface peaks and shake-up satellites were included. This information was useful for fitting of the complex Fe 2p3/2 spectra for Fe3O4 where both Fe2+ and Fe3+ species are present. It was found that as the ionic bond character of the iron —ligand bond increased, the binding energy associated with either the ferrous or ferric 2p3/2 photoelectron peak also increased. This was determined to be due to the decrease in shielding of the iron cation by the more increasingly electronegative ligands. It was also observed that the difference in energy between a high-spin iron 2p3/2 peak and its corresponding shake-up satellite peak increased as the electronegativity of the ligand increased. The extrinsic loss spectra for ion oxides are also reported; these are as characteristic of each species as are the photoelectron peaks. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

There are multiple ways to control surface charge buildup during XPS measurements, and examples of systems on advanced XPS instruments are described. There is no single, simple, and foolproof way to extract binding energies on insulating material, but advantages and limitations of several approaches are described.

	abstract = {Phenylalanine was the minimalistic and ﬁrst of numerous nonproteinaceous building blocks to be demonstrated to form amyloid-like ﬁbrils. This unexpected organization of such a simple building block into canonical architecture, which was previously observed only with proteins and peptides, has numerous implications for medicine and supramolecular chemistry. However, the morphology of phenylalanine ﬁbrils and their mechanical properties was never characterized in solutions. Here, using electron and atomic force microscopy, we analyze the morphological and mechanical properties of phenylalanine ﬁbrils in both air and ﬂuids. The ﬁbrils demonstrate an exceptionally high Young’s modulus (up to 30 GPa) and are found to be composed of intertwined protoﬁlaments in a helical or twisted ribbon morphology. In addition, X-ray scattering experiments provide convincing evidence of an amyloidal cross-β-like secondary structure within the nanoassemblies. Furthermore, increasing the phenylalanine concentration results in the formation of highly homogenous, noncrystalline, self-healing hydrogels that display storage and loss moduli signiﬁcantly higher than similar noncovalently cross-linked biomolecular nanoﬁbrillar scaﬀolds. These remarkably stiﬀ nanoﬁbrillar hydrogels can be harnessed for various technological and biomedical applications, such as self-healing, printable, structural, load-bearing 3D scaﬀolds. The properties of this simple but quite remarkable hydrogel open a possibility to utilize it in the biomaterial industry.},

	abstract = {Candida albicans is one of the most prevalent fungal pathogens, causing both mucosal candidiasis and invasive candidemia. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), part of the human innate immune system, have been shown to exhibit antifungal activity but have not been eﬀective as pharmaceuticals because of low activity and selectivity in physiologically relevant environments. Nevertheless, studies on α-peptide AMPs have revealed key features that can be designed into more stable structures, such as the 14-helix of β-peptide-based oligomers. Here, we report on the ways in which two of those features, hydrophobicity and helicity, govern the activity and selectivity of 14-helical β-peptides against C. albicans and human red blood cells. Our results reveal both antifungal activity and hemolysis to correlate to hydrophobicity, with intermediate levels of hydrophobicity leading to high antifungal activity and high selectivity toward C. albicans. Helical structure-forming propensity further inﬂuenced this window of selective antifungal activity, with more stable helical structures eliciting speciﬁcity for C. albicans over a broader range of hydrophobicity. Our ﬁndings also reveal cooperativity between hydrophobicity and helicity in regulating antifungal activity and speciﬁcity. The results of this study provide critical insight into the ways in which hydrophobicity and helicity govern the activity and speciﬁcity of AMPs and identify criteria that may be useful for the design of potent and selective antifungal agents.},

              In the natural peptides, helices are stabilized by hydrogen bonds that point backward along the sequence direction. Until now, there is only little evidence for the existence of analogous structures in oligomers of conformationally unrestricted β amino acids. We specifically designed the β peptide Ac-(β

              -LysH

              to form native like helical structures in the gas phase. The design follows the known properties of the peptide Ac-Ala

              -LysH
              +
              that forms a α helix in isolation. We perform ion-mobility mass-spectrometry and vibrational spectroscopy in the gas phase, combined with state-of-the-art density-functional theory simulations of these molecular systems in order to characterize their structure. We can show that the straightforward exchange of alanine residues for the homologous β amino acids generates a system that is generally capable of adopting native like helices with backward oriented H-bonds. By pushing the limits of theory and experiments, we show that one cannot assign a single preferred structure type due to the densely populated energy landscape and present an interpretation of the data that suggests an equilibrium of three helical structures.},

	abstract = {Using an atomic force microscope, we have studied three-dimensional molecular topography and calcium-sensitive conformational changes of individual hemichannels. Full-length (non-truncated) Cx43 hemichannels (connexons), when reconstituted in lipid bilayer, appear as randomly distributed individual particles and clusters. They show a lack of preferential orientation of insertion into lipid membrane; in a single bilayer, connexons with protrusion of either the extracellular face or the large non-truncated cytoplasmic face are observed. Extracellular domains of these undocked hemichannels are structurally different from hemichannels in the docked gap junctional plaques examined after their exposure by force dissection or chemical dissection. Calcium induced a reversible change in the extracellular pore diameter. Hemichannels imaged in a physiological buffer with 1.8 mm Ca+2 had the pore diameter of ∼1.8 nm, consistent with the closed channel conformation. Reducing Ca+2 concentration to ∼1.4, 1, and 0 mm, which changes hemichannels from the closed to open conformation, increased the pore diameter to ∼2.5 nm for ∼27, 74, and 100\% of hemichannels, respectively. Thus, open/close probability of the hemichannel appears to be [Ca2+]-dependent. Computational analysis of the atomic force microscopy phase mode imaging reveals a significantly higher interfacial energy for open hemichannels that results from the interactions between the atomic force microscope probe and the hydrophobic domains. Thus, hydrophobic extracellular domains of connexins regulate calcium-dependent conformational changes.},

	abstract = {Whereas α-peptides are rapidly degraded in vivo and in vitro by a multitude of peptidases, substrates constructed entirely of or incorporating homologated α-amino acid (i.e., β-amino acid) units exhibit a superior stability profile. Efforts made so far to proteolytically hydrolyze a ββ peptide bond have not proved fruitful; a study aimed at breaching this proteolytic stability is discussed here. A series of such bonds have been designed with side-chain groups similar in relative positions (constitution) and three-dimensional arrangements (configuration) as found about α-peptidic amide bonds. Increasing the prospect for degradation would permit the tuning of β-peptide stability; here, however, no cleavage was observed (1, 2, 4–6, Table 1). Peptides comprised of α- and β-amino acids (mixed α,β-peptides, 8–11) are expected to benefit from both recognition by a natural receptor and a high level of proteolytic stability, ideal characteristics of pharmacologically active compounds. β3-Peptides containing α-amino acid moieties at the N-terminus are degraded, albeit slowly, by several peptidases. Of particular interest is the ability of pronase to cleave an αβ peptide bond, namely that of αAlaβ3hAla. Significantly, successful hydrolysis is independent of the configuration of the β-amino acid. Some of the α,β-peptides discussed here are being investigated for their binding affinities to class I MHC proteins. The computer-programming steps required to prepare α,β-peptides on an automated peptide synthesizer are presented.},

It is less widely recognized that intensities in XPS spectra can also be used to obtain information on the chemical composition of the surface of the sample and the depth distribution of chemical species. Transforming XPS data into meaningful information on the concentration and distribution of chemical species is the topic of this article. In principle, the process is straightforward, but there are a number of pitfalls that must be avoided to ensure that the information is representative and as accurate as possible. This paper sets out the things that should be considered to obtain reliable, meaningful, and useful information from quantitative XPS. This includes the necessity for reference data, instrument performance checks, and a consistent and methodical method for the separation of inelastic background from peaks.

A description of the instrumentation helps a novice user understand how data are acquired, and information is included on sample preparation and mounting. The important parameters for data acquisition are noted to help guide users starting to acquire data.

	abstract = {The physical and chemical effects of the soft X-ray irradiation of polymers have been systematically evaluated for photon energies just above the C 1s binding energy. This exposure causes radiation damage in the form of the loss of mass and changes to the chemical structure of the polymers. These effects are evident in the Near Edge X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (NEXAFS) spectra of the exposed polymers, posing a fundamental limit to the sensitivity of NEXAFS spectroscopy for chemical microanalysis. Quantitative understanding of the chemistry and kinetics of radiation damage in polymers is necessary for the successful and validated application of NEXAFS microscopy. This paper outlines a method for quantifying this radiation damage as a function of X-ray dose, and applies these methods to characterize the loss of mass and loss of carbonyl group functionality from a diverse series of polymers. A series of simple correlations are proposed to rationalize the observed radiation damage propensities on the basis of the polymer chemical structure. In addition, NEXAFS spectra of irradiated and virgin polymers are used to provide a ﬁrst-order identiﬁcation of the radiation chemistry. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

At the atomic scale, besides the (Auger and photo) electron transport in the bulk or the ejection into the surrounding media, special attention is devoted to the specific consequences of the initial Auger decay mechanism. At the macroscopic scale, the decisive role of the poor electronic conductivity of the radiation-sensitive materials is outlined and it is shown that the damaging effects occur in irradiated insulators because the lack of conduction electrons prevents the initial charge of the excited atoms being quickly restored. Correlating irradiation conditions and physical properties of the specimen, various expressions are proposed for the first time to quantify these effects. Some are neither dose- nor dose-rate-dependent and the influence of the surrounding medium is also considered. The fundamental mechanisms investigated here hold for a wide variety of specimens or components investigated in X-ray microscopy. Their consequences can be easily transposed to other techniques using transmitted X-rays.},

	abstract = {Ar+ sputter etching is often used prior to X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses with the intention to remove surface oxides and contaminants. Since the XPS probing depth is comparable to the thickness of the ionbeam modified layer the signal from the latter dominates the spectra. We check here the conditions for reliable XPS analysis by studying ion irradiation effects for single-phase Group IVB transition metal (IVB-TM) boride, carbide, nitride, and oxide thin film specimens. The extent of sputter damage, manifested by changes in the surface composition, binding energy shift, peak broadening, and the appearance of new spectral features, varies greatly between material systems: from subtle effects in the case of IVB-TM carbides to a complete change of spectral components for IVB-TM oxides. The determining factors are: (i) the nature of compounds that may form as a result of ion-induced mixing in the affected layer together with (ii) the final elemental composition after sputtering, and (iii) the thickness of the Ar+-affected layer with respect to the XPS probing depth. Our results reveal that the effects of Ar+ ion irradiation on XPS spectra cannot be a priori neglected and a great deal of scrutiny, if not restraint, is necessary during spectra interpretation.},

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) test is one of the most significant characterization methods to analyze the surfaces. The carbon species and banding energies for several typical kinds of carbon materials (graphite, carbon black, graphene, carbon nanotubes, carbides, and polymers) were summarized with typical XPS spectra. It can be found that carbon materials with different preparation methods, analytical methods or storage times possess quite different carbon species and banding energies. Meanwhile, classical XPS figures and analysis results of every carbon material were illustrated, which provides the researchers an intuitive understanding of the related analytical method. Therefore, much more accurate results of XPS spectra for related carbon materials can be obtained.},

	abstract = {In this review we describe the Auger parameter concept and its relation to the ﬁnal state relaxation energy. After a historical introduction we illustrate the several models proposed to calculate relaxation energies and Auger parameter shifts. It is stressed how the initial empirical approach of the Auger parameter concept developed by Wagner in the early 1970s is now changed thanks to the elaboration of theoretical models based on classical electrostatic and quantum chemistry. The Auger parameter permits to obtain information on the local chemical environment of core-ionized atoms. Even more information can be obtained arranging photoemission and Auger lines in the format of the so called Wagner plots (chemical state plots). These plots contain information on the initial state effects, i.e. the Madelung potential and the ground state valence atomic charge at the coreionized atom, and on the ﬁnal state relaxation energy. By means of the point–charge potential approximation, the Auger parameter and the Wagner plot, we describe a simple semiquantitative model useful to rationalize the dependence of the local electronic structure on the atomic environment. The Auger parameter is useful to study the screening mechanism in the ﬁnal state of the photoemission process. In the case of the non-local screening mechanism (polarization of the charge from the nearest-neighbour ligands towards extended empty orbitals of the core-ionized atom) a simple electrostatic model permits the estimation of the Auger parameter shifts. It is shown that the Auger parameter shift is a function of the number, distance, electronic polarizability and local geometry of the nearest-neighbour ligands around the core-ionized atom. The electrostatic model has been applied successfully for interpreting Auger parameter shifts of core-ionized atoms in insulators and semiconductors compounds. On the other hand, when the electrostatic model cannot be applied, as in the case of the local screening mechanism (complete tranfer of one electron towards empty and localized orbitals of the core-ionized atom), the extended potential model of the Auger parameter is able to relate the potential in an atomic core to the atomic valence charge. According to this model the Auger parameter shift depends on atomic properties of the core-ionized atom, obtained from atomic structure calculations, on the valence charge in the initial state and on the screening charge in the ﬁnal state. It has been applied successfully for interpreting metal-free atom and alloy–pure metal Auger parameter shifts. Other models of the Auger parameter based on electrostatics, quantum chemistry and thermochemistry are also reviewed. ᭧ 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

This analytical method is demonstrated by comparing the Fe(2p) spectra of electrochemically modified Ve2+-richand Fe3+-rich electrodes in a combined UHV-XPS-electrochemical system. Exposure of clean polycrystalline Fe surfaces to low pressures of O2 gas for different time intervals has also been carried out. Quantitative XPS analyses of the oxide films produced by 0 2 exposures reveal that the oxide films are predominantly trilayers of FeO, Fe30 4 and FeOOH phases, the latter due to ambient background contamination. The analyses demonstrate that a multiplicity of Fe2+ and/or Fe 3 {\textasciitilde} chemical environments and binding energies is present in such films, and this must be explicitly accounted for during quantitative analyses. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

In particular, for elements which are conductors with inner shell vacancies, the doubly ionized final state results in substantial differences in screening energy, which reflects largely in the Auger line shifts. The Auger parameter, involving measurements of both Auger and photoelectron line energies, provides abundant chemical state information without the necessity or concern for charge correction and work function measurements. Since the change in Auger parameter is equal to twice the change in extraatomic relaxation energy, it is also a direct measure of the electronic interaction with the surrounding atoms. Data are presented showing systematic variations in Auger parameter values of several cations with the type and number of participating anions. The physical state of the element/ compound, whether solid, gas or in solution, is also shown to profoundly influence the Auger parameter. Finally a number of special situations such as condensed, implanted and adsorbed atoms at solid surfaces and the role of lattice structure in selected oxide systems on the Auger parameter are discussed.},

	abstract = {X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is an analytical technique that uses photoelectrons excited by X-ray radiation (usually Mg Kα or Al Kα) for the characterization of surfaces to a depth of 2–5 nm. Elemental identification and information on chemical bonding are derived from the measured electron energy and energy shifts, respectively. The use of ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) during analysis requires special sample handling. Depth profiling is possible using ion sputtering. In contrast to the most popular surface analytical technique, Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), nonconducting material can be investigated, little material damage occurs, and the chemical shifts are easier to interpret. However, the lateral resolution of AES (typically 50 nm) is much greater than for XPS (50 µm for standard equipment, down to lower than 3 µm for dedicated instruments). The detection limit (of about 0.1 atom \%) is not as low as for mass spectroscopic techniques, but the quantification from XPS peak area measurements is much better, even disclaiming standard sample measurements. This article briefly discusses the principles of the technique, sample requirements, and the typical measuring strategy. Possible information sources (elements, chemical bonding, depth and lateral distributions) are described and their quantification principles are summarized. The main part deals with typical applications relating to several material classes (metals, semiconductors, insulators, polymers) to give a feeling for the effectiveness of the method over a wide range of research and technological problems. A comparison with similar techniques is given as a summary. Technological developments in electronics, nanotechnology, polymers, biotechnology and medicine are all concerned with surface-related phenomena, suggesting sustained interest in XPS in the foreseeable future.},

	doi = {10.3389/fchem.2020.00217},
	abstract = {β3-peptides consisting exclusively of β3-amino acids adopt a variety of non-natural helical structures and can self-assemble into well-defined hierarchical structures by axial head-to-tail self-assembly resulting in fibrous materials of varying sizes and shapes. To allow control of fiber morphology, a lipid moiety was introduced within a tri-β3-peptide sequence at each of the three amino acid positions and the N-terminus to gain finer control over the lateral assembly of fibers. Depending on the position of the lipid, the self-assembled structures formed either twisted ribbon-like fibers or distinctive multilaminar nanobelts. The nanobelt structures were comprised of multiple layers of peptide fibrils as revealed by puncturing the surface of the nanobelts with an AFM probe. This stacking phenomenon was completely inhibited through changes in pH, indicating that the layer stacking was mediated by electrostatic interactions. Thus, the present study is the first to show controlled self-assembly of these fibrous structures, which is governed by the location of the acyl chain in combination with the 3-point H-bonding motif. Overall, the results demonstrate that the nanostructures formed by the β3-tripeptide foldamers can be tuned via sequential lipidation of N-acetyl β3-tripeptides which control the lateral interactions between peptide fibrils and provide defined structures with a greater homogeneous population.},

	abstract = {The development of science and technology of advanced materials using nanoscale units can be conducted by a novel concept involving combination of nanotechnology methodology with various research disciplines, especially supramolecular chemistry. The novel concept is called ‘nanoarchitectonics’ where self-assembly processes are crucial in many cases involving a wide range of component materials. This review of self-assembly processes re-examines recent progress in materials nanoarchitectonics. It is composed of three main sections: (1) the first short section describes typical examples of self-assembly research to outline the matters discussed in this review; (2) the second section summarizes self-assemblies at interfaces from general viewpoints; and (3) the final section is focused on self-assembly processes at interfaces. The examples presented demonstrate the strikingly wide range of possibilities and future potential of self-assembly processes and their important contribution to materials nanoarchitectonics. The research examples described in this review cover variously structured objects including molecular machines, molecular receptors, molecular pliers, molecular rotors, nanoparticles, nanosheets, nanotubes, nanowires, nanoflakes, nanocubes, nanodisks, nanoring, block copolymers, hyperbranched polymers, supramolecular polymers, supramolecular gels, liquid crystals, Langmuir monolayers, Langmuir–Blodgett films, self-assembled monolayers, thin films, layer-by-layer structures, breath figure motif structures, two-dimensional molecular patterns, fullerene crystals, metal–organic frameworks, coordination polymers, coordination capsules, porous carbon spheres, mesoporous materials, polynuclear catalysts, DNA origamis, transmembrane channels, peptide conjugates, and vesicles, as well as functional materials for sensing, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, photovoltaics, charge transport, excitation energy transfer, light-harvesting, photocatalysts, field effect transistors, logic gates, organic semiconductors, thin-film-based devices, drug delivery, cell culture, supramolecular differentiation, molecular recognition, molecular tuning, and hand-operating (hand-operated) nanotechnology.},

Governed by their physicochemical characteristics, the peptides can form a variety of structures with greater reactivity than conventional non-biological materials. The structural divergence of self-assembling peptides allows for various functional possibilities; when assembled, they can be used as scaffolds for cell and tissue regeneration, and vehicles for drug delivery, conferring controlled release, stability, and targeting, and avoiding side effects of drugs. These peptides can also be used as drugs themselves. In this review, we describe the basic structure and characteristics of self-assembling peptides and the various factors that affect the formation of peptide-based structures. We also summarize the applications of self-assembling peptides in the treatment of various diseases, including cancer. Furthermore, the in-cell self-assembly of peptides, termed reverse self-assembly, is discussed as a novel paradigm for self-assembling peptide-based nanovehicles and nanomedicines.},

We report REELS observation in AES at low voltages of losses (plasmons and inter-band transitions) corresponding to the satellite structures in Ni metal 2p spectra. The satellite near 6eV is attributed to a predominant surface plasmon loss. A current interpretation of Ni 2p spectra of oxides and other compounds is based on charge transfer assignments of the main peak at 854.6eV and the broad satellite centred at around 861eV to the cd9L and the unscreened cd8 final-state configurations, respectively (L is a ligand hole). Multiplet splittings have been shown to be necessary for assignment of Fe 2p and Cr 2p spectral profiles and chemical states. The assignments of Ni 2p states are re-examined with intra-atomic multiplet envelopes applied to Ni(OH)2, NiOOH and NiO spectra. It is shown that the free ion multiplet envelopes for Ni2+ and Ni3+ simulate the main line and satellite structures for Ni(OH)2 and NiOOH. Fitting the NiO Ni 2p spectral profile is not as straightforward as the hydroxide and oxyhydroxide. It may involve contributions from inter-atomic, non-local electronic coupling and screening effects with multiplet structures significantly different from the free ions as found for MnO. A scheme for fitting these spectra using multiplet envelopes is proposed.},

This method of elastic scattering is used in various branches of science and technology, includ­ ing condensed matter physics, molecular biology and biophysics, polymer science, and metallurgy. Many small-angle scattering studies are of value for pure science and practical applications. It is well known that the most general and informative method for investigating the spatial structure of matter is based on wave-diffraction phenomena. In diffraction experiments a primary beam of radiation influences a studied object, and the scattering pattern is analyzed. In principle, this analysis allows one to obtain information on the structure of a substance with a spatial resolution determined by the wavelength of the radiation. Diffraction methods are used for studying matter on all scales, from elementary particles to macro-objects. The use of X rays, neutrons, and electron beams, with wavelengths of about 1 A, permits the study of the condensed state of matter, solids and liquids, down to atomic resolution. Determination of the atomic structure of crystals, i.e., the arrangement of atoms in a unit cell, is an important example of this line of investigation.},

	abstract = {It is impossible to directly measure the photoelectron spectrum of an atom using conventional XPS due to its low detection sensitivity. In this work, an indirect method has been developed to determine the binding energy (BE) of an atom. In this method, the BE of the atom can be obtained by extrapolation of the experimental BE curves with atomic deposition coverage to zero coverage. With this method, the Ni 2p3/2 BE's of atomic Ni on TiO2(001) and (110) surfaces are deduced to be 853.69 and 853.55 eV, respectively. Compared with atomic Ni in gas phase, relaxation shifts of 7.34 and 7.48 eV are obtained on TiO2(001) and (110) surfaces, respectively. These values are very close to the relaxation shift of 7.3 eV due to d electron screening, indicating d-like screening effects from the TiO2 substrates after Ni 2p photoionization. This method is also used to determinate the Ni 2p3/2 BE's of atomic Ni on TiO2(001) with different surface stoichiometries. The difference of Ni 2p3/2 BE is due to different interfacial charge transfer. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {The first row transition metals are of immense importance to the worldwide economy in catalysts, batteries, magnetic materials, pigments, specialty chemicals, and in the emerging nano-materials field. An understanding of the bulk and surface chemistry of materials containing these elements is essential to improvements in basic research and to applied industrial process innovation. Chemical state X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic analysis of first row transition metals and their oxides and hydroxides is challenging due to the complexity of the 2p spectra resulting from peak asymmetries, complex multiplet splitting, shake-up and plasmon loss structure, and uncertain, overlapping binding energies. A review of current literature and databases has shown that the spectral fitting parameters for each specific transition metal species, i.e. binding energy (eV), full width at half maximum (FWHM) value (eV) for each pass energy, spin-orbit splitting values, and asymmetric peak shape fitting parameters, are not all normally provided. These are necessary for reproducible, quantitative chemical state analysis. Oxide and hydroxide species of Cr, Mn, Fe, Co and Ni particularly show intense, complex multiplet splitting and pose unique difficulties for chemical state analysis.
This thesis reports a more consistent, practical and effective approach to curve-fitting the various chemical states in a variety of first row transition metals, oxides, hydroxides, mixed oxides and selected halide species. The curve-fitting procedures proposed are based on a combination of 1) standard spectra from quality reference samples, 2) a survey of appropriate literature databases and literature references, 3) specific literature references where fitting procedures are available, and 4) fitting of multiplet split spectra based on spectra of numerous reference materials and theoretical XPS modelling of these transition metal species.
Binding energies, full-width at half maximum (FWHM) values, spin-orbit splitting values, asymmetric peak-shape fitting parameters, multiplet split peak shape fitting parameters and Auger parameter values are presented. Curve fitting techniques applied to a variety of chemistries are demonstrated with limitations and special cases discussed. A quantification procedure for Cu species details the use of the shake-up satellites for Cu(II)-containing compounds and the exact binding energies of the Cu(0) and Cu(I) peaks. An extended focus on Ni containing species is also presented. Quantification of mixed nickel chemical states and the qualitative determination of low concentrations of Ni(III) species is demonstrated via an approach based on standard spectra from quality reference samples (Ni, NiO, Ni(OH)2, NiOOH), subtraction of these spectra, and data analysis that integrates information from the Ni 2p and O 1s spectra. An improved calculation of thin film oxides is presented. An analysis of the Auger parameter and Wagner plots for a series of Ni species allows for the elucidation of initial and final state effects, and a greater understanding of bonding within these species.
Published results of the application of these improved methods with significant improvement in quantification are now becoming available. These include analyses of titanium composites, nanocrystals, catalysts, oxidation and corrosion processes, thermoelectric materials, photovoltaics and solar materials, electrochemically produced films, mineral surfaces, corrosion inhibitors, coatings and thin films, nanocrystals, nanocatylsts, nanowires and nanoparticles.},

	abstract = {Understanding the role that metal ions play in biological and material processes is critical to addressing a number of diseases and problems facing society today. There have been a number of studies that have begun to approach this concern from a myriad of different perspectives. However, there is still a considerable lack of understanding concerning the mechanisms and structures of metal-related problems, specifically biological and medical-related issues. Understanding the mechanism of ingestion and uptake of metals into the human body is critical to addressing many diseases such as Alzheimer’s and certain types of cancers. Using computational techniques, this work adds to the overall understanding of metal interactions with proteins by focusing on metal ion interactions with the amino acid, histidine, one of the most common sites of metal attachment. In this work, the geometries of single and dual histidines attached to Ni2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+ ions at B3LYP/6-311G(d) are presented. The results show stable octahedral complexes associated with each of the metal ions. Free energy calculations suggest that all three complexes are spontaneous in the formation of the dual histidine-metal complexes. Nickel and copper are spontaneous in the formation of the single histidine complex, although the copper complex undergoes slight geometric changes. Zinc is found to be nonspontaneous in forming the single histidine complex. Finally, the reduction potential of the single histidine-metal complex is presented. All of the complexes show positive reduction potentials. However, the nickel and copper complexes undergo geometrical changes to adopt a square planar conformation.},

	abstract = {Spontaneous formation of nanostructured materials of defined structure and morphology is a crucial milestone toward realizing true bottom-up nanofabrication. Supramolecular recognition offers unparalleled specificity, selectivity and geometric flexibility to design hierarchical nanostructures. However, competition between similar binding motifs and the dynamic nature of the attachment imposes a severe limitation on the complexity of the achievable structures. Here we outline a design based on two distinct binding motifs in a supramolecular fibrous assembly to realize a metallosupramolecular framework (MSF). Controlled geometries were achieved by one-dimensional supramolecular assembly of substituted oligoamide units. The assembly of the monomers yields nanorods of sub-nanometer diameter and lengths in the 100 μm range. Addition of Cu2+ led to the formation of well aligned two-dimensional arrays on mica surface. Vibrational spectroscopy confirmed that the backbone amide moieties are not affected by metal addition. XPS and NEXAFS results suggest that Cu(II) is reduced in the process to a mixture of Cu(I) and Cu(0), likely in an interaction with the amine moiety of the imidazole side chain. Our results indicate that the two dimensional superstructure is based on the formation of polynuclear metal complexes between the oligoamide nanorods, thus the structure is confirmed to be a metallosupramolecular framework.},

Peptide-based self-assembly systems exploit the ability of peptides to adopt distinct secondary structures and have been used to produce a range of well-defined nanostructures, such as nanotubes, nanofibres, nanoribbons, nanospheres, nanotapes and nanorods. While most of these systems involve self-assembly of α-peptides, more recently β-peptides have also been reported to undergo supramolecular self-assembly which have been used to produce materials, such as hydrogels, that are tailored for applications in tissue engineering, cell culture and drug delivery. This review provides an overview of self-assembled peptide nanostructures obtained via the supramolecular self-assembly of short β-peptide foldamers with a specific focus on N-acetyl-β3-peptides and their applications as bio- and nanomaterials.},

Of particular interest were (i) the instantaneous pressures beneath the tip, (ii) the contributions from the tip–sample interaction to the damping of the cantilever, and (iii) the role of capillary forces in determining the cantilever response.

Upon Cu(II) addition, atomic force microscopy and small angle neutron scattering revealed morphologic changes specific to KE but absent in EE. Vibration spectroscopy measurements revealed that Cu(II) can coordinate to the amine moieties of the side chains, without direct effect on the backbone amides. While coordination in excess solvent lead to regular nanostructures, fast drying of the sample yielded oligoamide templated crystallization of CuCl2. The metal coordination crosslinking of supramolecular assemblies as reported here is the first realization of a metallosupramolecular framework structure.},

The connectivity and site symmetry of a node are probably the most important factors affecting the net topology of MOFs. Many MOFs with multiple nodes of different connectivity and site symmetry have complicated net topologies. However, the underlying net topology of some complicated MOFs could be analyzed using a hierarchical simplification approach. The underlying net topology of complicated MOFs with multi-connected nodes could be analyzed using a metal–organic polyhedron composed of multiple nodes as either a secondary building unit or a tertiary building unit. The simplified net topology provides better insight into the structural features of the complicated MOF structures and could be utilized in designing new MOF structures with known and/or unprecedented net topologies.},

	abstract = {The oxidation of polycrystalline nickel (Ni) metal surfaces after exposure to oxygen gas (O2) at 25 and 300 °C and pressures near 130 Pa, was studied using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Oxide structures involving both divalent (Ni2+) and trivalent (Ni3+) species could be distinguished using Ni 2p spectra, while surface adsorbed O2 and atomic oxygen (O) species could be differentiated from bulk oxide (O2−) using O 1s spectra. Oxide thicknesses and distributions were determined using QUASES™, and the average oxide thickness was verified using the Strohmeier formula. The reaction kinetics for oxide films grown at 300 °C followed a parabolic mechanism, with an oxide thickness of greater than 4 nm having formed after 60 min. Exposure at 25 °C followed a direct logarithmic mechanism with an oxide growth rate about four to five times slower than at 300 °C. Reaction of a Ni (100) single crystal under comparable conditions showed much slower reaction rates compared to polycrystalline specimens. The higher reaction rate of the polycrystalline materials is attributed to grain boundary transport of Ni cations. Oxide thickness was measured on a microscopic scale for polycrystalline Ni exposed to large doses of O2 at 25 and 300 °C. The thickness of oxide was not strongly localized on this scale. However, the QUASES™ analysis suggests that there is localized growth on a nanometric scale—the result of island formation. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Throughout the evolution of XPS, the ability to compensate for surface charging and accurately calibrate the binding energy scale, particularly with electrically inhomogeneous samples, has remained one of the most intractable problems. The last decade, however, has seen some quite significant advances in this area. Best exemplified perhaps by the Kratos (UK) ‘in the lens’ electrostatic mirror/electron source coupled with a magnetic immersion lens, a number of concepts have been advanced that take a quite different conceptual approach to charge compensation. They differ in a number of fundamental ways from the electron flood-type compensators, which are widely used and historically are absolutely essential with instruments based on monochromatized sources. Even more recent has been the use of combined ion and electron flood systems. Thus, modern approaches to compensation represent a more sophisticated understanding both of how charging arises and how it may be mitigated to improve the accuracy and utility of XPS spectra.

By analyzing the band structures and charge densities of the vertical stacks using first-principles calculations, we reveal that the interlayer coupling is a function of the interlayer distance and is relatively insensitive to the angle of misorientation.},

	abstract = {Exfoliation of large-area monolayers is important for fundamental research and technological implementation of transitionmetal dichalcogenides. Various techniques have been explored to increase the exfoliation yield, but little is known about the underlying mechanism at the atomic level. Here, we demonstrate gold-assisted mechanical exfoliation of monolayer molybdenum disulﬁde, up to a centimeter scale. Detailed spectroscopic, microscopic, and ﬁrstprinciples density functional theory analyses reveal that strong van der Waals (vdW) interaction between Au and the topmost MoS2 layer facilitates the exfoliation of monolayers. However, the large-area exfoliation promoted by such strong vdW interaction is only achievable on freshly prepared clean and smooth Au surfaces, while rough surfaces and surfaces exposed to air for more than 15 min result in negligible exfoliation yields. This technique is successfully extended to MoSe2, WS2, WSe2, MoTe2, WTe2, and GaSe. In addition, electrochemical characterization reveals intriguing interactions between monolayer MoS2 and Au. A subnanometer-thick MoS2 monolayer strongly passivates the chemical properties of the underlying Au, and the Au signiﬁcantly modulates the electronic band structure of the MoS2, turning it from semiconducting to metallic. This could ﬁnd applications in many areas, including electrochemistry, photovoltaics, and photocatalysis.},

Thus, the residual energy shift due to sample charging, especially if the surface conductivity changes during measurement, could be removed.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data acquisition using both Mg Kα and monochromatic Al Kα x-ray sources shows that confusing and potentially misleading results can be obtained if samples are mounted such that only part of the surface is grounded to the spectrometer. In this case, multiple photoelectron peaks were observed for each photoelectron line of each element in the sample. However, more significant differential charging artifacts were observed from the insulating glass than from the ITO. The proximal causes of the photoelectron peak shifts were evaluated using imaging XPS in conjunction with small-area spectroscopy.},

The irregularity of the sample surfaces necessitated a more elaborate background correction than is usually applied in such imaging. Areas of active pitting were found to contain corrosion products that are high in chromium oxide and depleted in nickel and iron. Sites of anodic activity on the surface were able to be defined more clearly using principal component analysis. Elements that are dissolved preferentially are deposited cathodically within well-defined regions whose distance from the anodic pit appears related to the open-circuit potential.

This shift, which is well-reproduced by relativistic spin-orbit ZORA calculations, is indicative of a depletion of electron density on the central metal. Such a depletion of electron density is related to the macrocycle-induced changes in the metal-ligand interactions. In the porphyrazine complex both the ligand to metal [Formula: see text] donation and the metal to ligand [Formula: see text]-back donation increase. The latter increases slightly more than the former, however, leading to a decrease of electron density on the central metal.},

Analyses of the metal and alloys are consistent with other works, showing that final state relaxation shifts, ΔR, are determined predominantly by changes in the d electron population and are insensitive to inter-atomic charge transfer. The nickel halide Auger parameters are dominated by initial state effects, Δε, with increasing positive charge on the core nickel ion induced by increasing electronegativity of the ligands. This effect is much greater than the final state shifts; however, the degree of covalency is reflected in the Wagner plot where the more polarizable iodide and bromide have greater ΔR. The initial state shift for NiO is much smaller than those of Ni(OH)2 or NiOOH and the effective oxidation state is much less than that inferred from the average electronegativity of the ligand(s). Auger parameter analysis indicates that the bonding in NiO appears to have stronger contributions from initial state charge transfer from the oxygen ligands than that in the hydroxide and oxyhydroxide consistent with the considerable differences in the Ni–O bond lengths in these compounds with some relaxation of this state occurring during final state phenomena. The Auger parameter of NiOOH is, however, shifted positively, like the iodide, indicating greater polarizability of the ligands and covalency in this bonding. There is support for more direct use of relative bond lengths in interpreting differences between related compounds rather than more general electronegativity or similar parameters.},

	abstract = {The metal carboxylate complexes present in the organic solutions used in the hydrolytic stripping process strongly affect the nature of the solid precipitated; in some cases, the product is a mixed oxide while in others, a mixture of single-metal oxides is obtained. Infrared (IR) spectroscopy is a useful tool for determining the speciation of metal loaded organic phases. In the previous work, relationships of the form [V-10]=αAνM+βAνD were obtained for the estimation of the free Versatic acid present in metal carboxylate solutions at given specific temperatures. In this work, infrared spectroscopy has been used for the speciation of single-metal Versatic 10™ solutions containing Fe(III), Zn and Ni at temperatures between 20 and 200 °C. It was found that iron and zinc predominantly form complexes with bidentate structures at all the concentration levels tested, while the nickel complexes contain bidentate ligands at low concentrations and both monodentate and bidentate ligands at high concentrations. The evidence found in this work supports the existence of a binuclear ferric Versatic complex, [Fe(OH)V2]2, with chelating Versatic groups forming an octahedron around each of the iron atoms. An oxo-centred structure, containing only bridging carboxylate groups, is proposed for the zinc Versatic complex, which is believed to be present in the organic medium as Zn4O(V)6.},

The Raman scattering peaks observed for these samples were ascribed to the neutral and positively charged imidazole groups on the basis of the spectral changes due to the pH variation and to the deuterium substitution of the imino protons. The vibrational modes of these peaks were deduced from the normal coordinate analysis made on the positively charged and neutral 4-ethylimidazoles. The Raman scattering peaks from the imidazole groups in the neutral form clearly indicate that these imidazole groups exist in the equilibrium between the two tautomeric forms, the 1-N protonated from (tautomer I) and the 3-N protonated one (tautomer II). For example, the breathing vibration of the 1-N protonated form is observed at 1282 cm−1 for L-histidine and at 1304 cm−1 for 4-methylimidazole, while the breathing vibration of the 3-N protonated form is observed at 1260 cm−1 for L-histidine and 4-methylimidazole. From the temperature dependence of the relative intensities of the tautomer I peak to that of the tautomer II, it was concluded that the tautomer I is energetically more stable than the tautomer II, and the ΔH value is 1.0 ± 0.3 kcal/mol for L-histidine and 0.4 ± 0.1 kcal/mol for 4-methylimidazole. Poly(L-histidine) with the neutral imidazole side chains shows the amide I peak at 1672 cm−1, indicating that the sample assumes the antiparallel pleated-sheet structure. Poly(L-Ala75L-His25) and poly(L-Ala50L-His50) were found to take the α-helical and β-form conformations, respectively.},

Also necessary is the ability to control the growth of thin MOF films and the positioning of size- and shape-selected crystals as well as MOF heterostructures on a given surface in a well-defined and oriented fashion. MOFs are solid-state materials typically formed by solvothermal reactions and their crystallization from the liquid phase involves the surface chemistry of their building blocks.

	abstract = {This paper reports several interrelated XPS investigations of the Cr–O system that provide additional interpretation of the Cr 2p3/2 spectra, along with more detail on the reaction mechanisms between O2 gas and H2O vapour with metallic Cr. The Cr 2p3/2 spectra of polycrystalline Cr2O3 contain multiplet structures that bear a strong resemblance to those calculated by Gupta and Sen for the free Cr3+ ion. The O/Cr ratio derived from the corrected Cr3+ and substitutional O2− intensities for all polycrystalline Cr2O3 samples was 1.5. Annealing of freshly cleaved polycrystalline Cr2O3 surfaces above 550 ◦C resulted in a sharpening of the multiplet structures that may be caused by the increased prevalence of the (0 0 0 1) Cr2O3 orientation on the surface. The slight difference in binding energies between the low energy (0 0 0 1) plane and the other major crystallographic orientations could contribute to the spectral broadening that is observed for the Cr 2p3/2 spectral line shapes. The Cr 2p3/2 spectrum for Cr(OH)3 was isolated from that produced by Cr2O3 and the multiplet structure was qualitatively re-assembled for that of the hydroxide. The Cr 2p3/2 and O 1s spectra of reaction products on polycrystalline metal surfaces were analysed using the above information. The oxidic portion of the Cr 2p3/2 spectra could be cleanly separated from the metallic substrate using spectral subtraction. Reactions of either O2 gas or H2O vapour both produced a thin Cr2O3 ﬁlm that was deﬁcient in Cr3+ and, depending on the reactant, showed varying concentrations of hypo-stoichiometric Cr moieties. The surface corrected O/Cr ratios calculated for all the oxidised surfaces were 1.7. There was little evidence to support the formation of Cr(OH)3 on these surfaces. For comparison, an aqueous reaction of a Ni–Cr (20\%) alloy was studied where both Cr(OH)3 and Cr2O3 components could be analysed. For this example no sub-stoichiometric Cr oxide species were produced.},

	abstract = {Hydrogen bonding is a fundamental element in protein structure and function. Breaking a single hydrogen bond may impair the stability of a protein. We report an infrared vibrational spectral marker for probing the hydrogen-bond number for buried, protonated Asp or Glu residues in proteins. Ab initio computational studies were performed on hydrogen-bonding interactions of a COOH group with a variety of side-chain model compounds of polar and charged amino acids in vacuum using density function theory. For hydrogen-bonding interactions with polar side-chain groups, our results show a strong correlation between the C¼O stretching frequency and the hydrogen bond number of a COOH group: ;1759–1776 cmÿ1 for zero, ;1733–1749 cmÿ1 for one, and 1703–1710 cmÿ1 for two hydrogen bonds. Experimental evidence for this correlation will be discussed. In addition, we show an approximate linear correlation between the C¼O stretching frequency and the hydrogen-bond strength. We propose that a two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy, C¼O stretching versus O-H stretching, may be employed to identify the speciﬁc type of hydrogen-bonding interaction. This vibrational spectral marker for hydrogen-bonding interaction is expected to enhance the power of time-resolved Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy for structural characterization of functionally important intermediates of proteins.},

	abstract = {Ferrous (Fe2+) and ferric (Fe3+) compounds were investigated by XPS to determine the usefulness of calculated multiplet peaks to fit high-resolution iron 2p3/2 spectra from high-spin compounds. The multiplets were found to fit most spectra well, particularly when contributions attributed to surface peaks and shake-up satellites were included. This information was useful for fitting of the complex Fe 2p3/2 spectra for Fe3O4 where both Fe2+ and Fe3+ species are present. It was found that as the ionic bond character of the iron —ligand bond increased, the binding energy associated with either the ferrous or ferric 2p3/2 photoelectron peak also increased. This was determined to be due to the decrease in shielding of the iron cation by the more increasingly electronegative ligands. It was also observed that the difference in energy between a high-spin iron 2p3/2 peak and its corresponding shake-up satellite peak increased as the electronegativity of the ligand increased. The extrinsic loss spectra for ion oxides are also reported; these are as characteristic of each species as are the photoelectron peaks. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

              amide nitrogen deprotonation and formation of metal–nitrogen bonds. Gas-phase models of metal-ion coordination can illuminate the factors governing this choice in condensed-phase proteins and enzymes. Here, structures of gas-phase complexes of Ni(

              ) and Cu(
              ii

In contrast, alkaline earth metal ion complexes prefer amide carbonyl oxygens chelating the metal ion with pyramidal geometry (charge-solvation, CS). Surprisingly, it is shown here that the Gly

As a consequence, a wide range of diseases results from abnormal interactions of such biomolecules. The main motivation of foldamer science is the development of scaffolds that are capable of adopting defined structures, mimicking parts of biological protagonists in their function. Among the most fundamental interactions in living beings are those between proteins, the so called protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Therefore, peptidic foldamers bear the promise to be an important tool for the inhibition of PPIs, as they are structurally most similar to the original proteins. The great number of possible permutations given by the combination of proteinogenic alpha-amino acid residues along with beta-amino acids opens the door for a larger pool of accessible structures with potential applications. Despite the increasing amount of new secondary structure motifs, only few examples for tertiary and quaternary structure design, as well as inhibition of PPIs, have been realized so far. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge and recent progress made in the field of alpha/beta-peptide foldamers beginning from secondary structure design up to highly sophisticated biological applications, such as protein surface recognition and inhibition of HIV cell entry.},

N-acyl β3 peptides, where all residues are unnatural amino acids, are able to form helical fibrous structures by a head-to-tail assembly of helical monomers, extending the helix via a three point supramolecular hydrogen bonding motif. These helical nanorods were shown to be stable under a wide range of physical conditions, offering a self-assembled analogue of polymeric fibres. Hitherto the self-assembly has only been demonstrated between identical monomers; however the self-assembly motif is sequence-independent, offering the possibility of hetero-assembly of different peptide monomers. Here we present a proof of principle study of head-to-tail co-assembly of two different helical unnatural peptides Ac-β3[WELWEL] and Ac-β3[LIA], where the letters denote the β3 analogues of natural amino acids. By atomic force microscopy imaging it was demonstrated that the homo-assembly and co-assembly of these peptides yield characteristically different structures. Synchrotron small angle X-ray scattering experiments have confirmed the presence of the fibres in the solution and the averaged diameters from modelled data correlate well to the results of AFM imaging. Hence, there is evidence of co-assembly of the fibrous superstructures; given that different monomers may be used to introduce variations into chemical and physical properties, the results demonstrate a self-assembled analogue of a statistical co-polymer that can be used in designing complex functional nanomaterials.},

In this study, mutants of Escherichia coli that lack copper homeostatic systems (copA cueO cus) were used to identify intracellular targets and to test the hypothesis that toxicity involves the action of reactive oxygen species. Low micromolar levels of copper were sufficient to inhibit the growth of both WT and mutant strains. The addition of branched-chain amino acids restored growth, indicating that copper blocks their biosynthesis. Indeed, copper treatment rapidly inactivated isopropylmalate dehydratase, an iron-sulfur cluster enzyme in this pathway. Other enzymes in this iron-sulfur dehydratase family were similarly affected. Inactivation did not require oxygen, in vivo or with purified enzyme. Damage occurred concomitant with the displacement of iron atoms from the solvent-exposed cluster, suggesting that Cu(I) damages these proteins by liganding to the coordinating sulfur atoms. Copper efflux by dedicated export systems, chelation by glutathione, and cluster repair by assembly systems all enhance the resistance of cells to this metal.},

A combination of crystallographic and magnetic susceptibility data for (depe)Fe(Mes)2 (depe = 1,2-bis(diethylphosphino)ethane) established a tetrahedral molecular geometry whereas SQUID magnetometry and Mössbauer spectroscopy on samples of (dppe)Fe(Mes)2 (dppe = 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane) indicated a planar molecule. When dissolved in chlorinated solvents, the latter compound promotes chlorine atom abstraction, forming tetrahedral (dppe)Fe(Mes)Cl and (dppe)FeCl2. Ligand substitution reactions have been studied for both structural types and are rapid on the NMR time scale at ambient temperature.},

The formation of mixed metal complexes is also discussed. We emphasize that binding features should be discussed by referring to the species that actually forms under speciﬁc conditions (pH, buffer, etc.) rather than to the “binding site”; correlating properties with the structures of the so called ‘binding sites’ may lead to misinterpretation of the experimental results, since a ‘binding site’ often corresponds to a mixture of species. We also highlight that ignoring species that form with ligands other than the prion peptide (e.g. the buffer) may lead to underestimating their role in crucial processes (e.g. redox activity).},

In this review, we summarized the studies on the fabrications and sensor applications of biomimetic nanostructures. The strategies for creating different bottom-up nanostructures by using biomolecules like DNA, protein, peptide, and virus, as well as microorganisms like bacteria and plant leaf are introduced. In addition, the potential applications of the synthesized biomimetic nanostructures for colorimetry, ﬂuorescence, surface plasmon resonance, surface-enhanced Raman scattering, electrical resistance, electrochemistry, and quartz crystal microbalance sensors are presented. This review will promote the understanding of relationships between biomolecules/microorganisms and functional nanomaterials in one way, and in another way it will guide the design and synthesis of biomimetic nanomaterials with unique properties in the future.},

	abstract = {Background: Among the 20 natural amino acids histidine is the most active and versatile member that plays the multiple roles in protein interactions, often the key residue in enzyme catalytic reactions. A theoretical and comprehensive study on the structural features and interaction properties of histidine is certainly helpful.
Results: Four interaction types of histidine are quantitatively calculated, including: (1) Cation-π interactions, in which the histidine acts as the aromatic π-motif in neutral form (His), or plays the cation role in protonated form (His+); (2) π-π stacking interactions between histidine and other aromatic amino acids; (3) Hydrogen-π interactions between histidine and other aromatic amino acids; (4) Coordinate interactions between histidine and metallic cations. The energies of π-π stacking interactions and hydrogen-π interactions are calculated using CCSD/6-31+G(d,p). The energies of cation-π interactions and coordinate interactions are calculated using B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) method and adjusted by empirical method for dispersion energy.
Conclusions: The coordinate interactions between histidine and metallic cations are the strongest one acting in broad range, followed by the cation-π, hydrogen-π, and π-π stacking interactions. When the histidine is in neutral form, the cation-π interactions are attractive; when it is protonated (His+), the interactions turn to repulsive. The two protonation forms (and pKa values) of histidine are reversibly switched by the attractive and repulsive cation-π interactions. In proteins the π-π stacking interaction between neutral histidine and aromatic amino acids (Phe, Tyr, Trp) are in the range from -3.0 to -4.0 kcal/mol, significantly larger than the van der Waals energies.},

	abstract = {The conformational features of a series of β-peptide models 1-11 have been studied by the molecular mechanics MM2* force-field and quantum mechanics methods. The geometries were optimized by the HF/ 6-31G** method. Energies were evaluated using the B3LYP/6-31G** method including solvent effect (SCIPCM). For the unsubstituted β-tripeptide model 1, calculations indicate that a 12-membered-ring hydrogenbonded structure and a 10-membered-ring hydrogen-bonded structure are low in energy. The coupling of these two structures forms the repeating unit for the 10/12-helix, indicating an intrinsic preference of the 10/12helix for a β-polypeptide. Indeed, calculations predict that an unsubstituted β-heptapeptide model 2 favors the 10/12-helix over the 14-helix by 21.4 and 4.8 kcal/mol in the gas phase and methanol solution, respectively. The side-chain effect on the relative preferences of the 14- and the 10/12-helices is analyzed based on torsional and steric effects, and has been tested by the calculations on β-peptide models 3-11. The methyl groups in (S)-β2/β3-polypeptide 9 and (S)-β2-polypeptide 11 have little torsional and steric effects for right-handed 10/ 12-helix and left-handed 14-helix, and these β-peptides are predicted to adopt the intrinsically favored 10/ 12-helix. On the other hand, (S)-β3-polypeptide 10 prefers to form a left-handed 14-helix in a polar solvent mainly because of torsional effects by three of the methyl groups in the 10/12-helix. The current study can be extended to evaluate the stabilities of the 10/12- and 14-helices for other sequences. For example, the 10/12helix is predicted to be the accessible conformation for (R)-β3/(S)-β3-, (S)-β2/(R)-β2-, (S)-β2/(R)-β3-, and (R)β3/(S)-β2-polypeptides.},

Macromol. Biosci. 2007, 7, 208). We have used a simple oligopeptide, Z-(LVal)2-L-Glu(OH)-OH, to grow porous copper and calcium MPFs. The MPFs form thanks to the selfassembling properties of the peptide and specific metal-peptide and metal-ammonia interactions. They are stable up to ca. 250 °C and have some internal porosity, which makes them a promising prototype for the further development of MPFs.},

	abstract = {Folded polymers are used in Nature for virtually every vital process. Nonnatural folded polymers, or foldamers, have the potential for similar versatility, and the design and refinement of such molecules is of considerable current interest. Here we report a complete and systematic analysis of the relationship between side chain structure and the 14-helicity of a well-studied class of foldamers, β3-peptides, in water. Our experimental results (1) verify the importance of macrodipole stabilization for maintaining 14-helix structure, (2) provide comprehensive evidence that β3-amino acids branched at the first side chain carbon are 14-helix-stabilizing, (3) suggest a novel role for side chain hydrogen bonding as an additional stabilizing force in β3-peptides containing β3-homoserine or β3-homothreonine, and (4) demonstrate that diverse functionality can be incorporated into a stable 14-helix. Gas- and solution-phase calculations and Monte Carlo simulations recapitulate the experimental trends only in the context of oligomers, yielding insight into the mechanisms behind 14-helix folding. The 14-helix propensities of β3-amino acids differ starkly from the R-helix propensities of analogous R-amino acids. This contrast informs current models for R-helix folding, and suggests that 14-helix folding is governed by different biophysical forces than is R-helix folding. The ability to modulate 14-helix structure through side chain choice will assist rational design of 14-helical β-peptide ligands for macromolecular targets.},

OM and Mc apo-b5 are also similar in that their empty heme-binding pockets (core 1) are highly disordered but that the remainder of each apoprotein (core 2) displays substantial hololike structure. Core 1 residue 71 is leucine in all known mammalian OM b5’s and serine in the corresponding Mc proteins. Replacing Leu-71 in rat OM (rOM) b5 with Ser has been shown to (1) decrease apoprotein thermodynamic stability by {\textgreater}2 kcal/mol and (2) extend conformational disorder beyond core 1 and into core 2, as evidenced in part by loss of a near-UV circular dichroism signal associated with the side chain of invariant residue Trp-22. Herein we report identification of a conserved Mc b5 core 2 packing motif that plays a key role in stabilizing apoprotein conformation in the vicinity of Trp-22, thereby compensating for the presence of Ser at position 71: a π-stacking interaction between the side chains of Trp-22 and His-15 that is extended by hydrogen bonding between the side chains of His-15, Ser-20, and Glu-11. The corresponding conserved packing motif in OM b5’s differs in having arginine at position 15 and glutamate at position 20. We also present evidence indicating that the conserved Mc b5 packing motif noted above contributes to the unusually extensive secondary structure exhibited by bovine Mc apo-b5 in the urea-denatured state.},

Hybrid helices can be realized by a combination of two or more different types of homologous and hybrid peptides, for example, β-peptides and R/β- and R/γ-hybrid peptides, within the same oligomer. The different helix types of the various peptide foldamer classes are maintained and form a regular helix along the sequence of the oligomer. The transition from one helix type to another was found to be rather smooth with high compatibility of the different helix types. Such hybrid helices represent novel motifs of secondary structure scaffolds. They open up the possibility to change the direction of helix propagation in a subtle manner. Hybrid helices enrich the arsenal of deﬁned foldamer structures for a structural and functional mimicry of native peptides and proteins.},

In this review article, we summarize our ongoing research endeavors to explore and discover microporous MOFs for gas separation and puriﬁcation. We have developed several approaches to systematically tune the pores and to immobilize functional sites, including (1) the primitive cubic net of interpenetrated microporous MOFs from the self-assembly of the paddle-wheel clusters, M2(CO2)4 (M = Cu2+, Zn2+. . .), with two types of organic dicarboxylic acid and pillar bidentate linkers; (2) microporous mixed-metal–organic frameworks (M0MOFs) through the metallo-ligands, and (3) microporous MOFs with dual functionalities. Such efforts have enabled us to make some breakthroughs on microporous MOFs for gas separation and puriﬁcation, as demonstrated in the gas chromatographic separation of hexane isomers, kinetic D2/H2 separation, acetylene/ethylene separation, carbon dioxide capture, C2H2/CO2 and C3H4/C3H6 separation. Our group is one of the ﬁrst groups who have envisioned the practical promise of microporous MOFs for the industrial gas separation and examined their separation capacities and efﬁciency using the ﬁxed-bed adsorption and/or breakthrough experiments. Some of the very important and representative examples of these microporous MOFs for diverse gas separation and puriﬁcation are highlighted in this review.},

The numerous choices of organic ligands and metal coordination geometries have led to the construction of porous MOFs with various compositions, network topologies, pore sizes and shapes and they possess high surface areas and low densities. The structures of MOFs can be tailor-tuned in such a way that any desired ligand or/and metal ion can be incorporated; this has given to researchers the advantage of designing MOFs for a targeted application. Within this review, we overview recent examples of a sub-class of MOFs namely biologically derived MOFs (bio-MOFs), made of multifunctional and commercially available biologically derived ligands (bio-ligands) such as: amino acids, peptides, nucleobases and saccharides and focus on their coordination chemistry with a variety of metals. Central to this review are four tables detailing the coordination modes of bio-ligands to metals, along with a visual representation of the bio-MOF that is subsequently formed. Through the detailed analysis of these structures, we highlight the structural impact of these ligands on the structure, and their contribution to the MOF properties and applications. Finally, we showcase the potential of bio-MOFs in several research areas such as CO2 capture, separation, catalysis, drug delivery and sensing.},

MOF materials demonstrate not only intriguing structures/topologies, but also a variety of functionalities/applications, i.e., mediating the currentdemanding energy crisis and environmental pollution. We are interested in the design and selfassembly of functional MOF materials to improve carbon dioxide, hydrogen, methane and acetylene storage capabilities, as well as the separation efﬁciencies toward ﬂue gas and nature gas. Therefore, signiﬁcant efforts have been devoted to construct a subclass of amide-functionalized metal–organic frameworks (AFMOFs) in the last decade in our research group to target the above-mentioned applications. Due to the intrinsic nature, i.e., ﬂexibility and polarizability of amide groups, the resultant AFMOFs unveil a myriad of graceful structures/topologies in combination with enhanced gas storage and separation properties. Depending on where the amide groups are implanted into the organic backbones, two types of AFMOFs were essentially afforded in our research group. In this review, we ﬁrst pay some attention to the synthesis and structures of dynamic AFMOFs, in which the amide groups are built between carboxymethyl and phenyl rings, then we discuss the designs, syntheses and constructions of robust AFMOFs by means of several intriguingly topological platforms, i.e., pcu-, agw-, nbo-, rht-, pbz- and txt-MOFs, where the amide groups are built between two phenyl rings. Later, several outstanding AFMOFs are chosen to elucidate their applications for energy gas storage and carbon capture, as well as acetylene safe handling.},

However, their practical applications are hindered by their high cost, the highly restricted catalytic conditions and their fragile nature. To solve these problems of enzymes for practical applications, biomimicry has therefore emerged as an effective approach to synthesize highly efﬁcient biomimetic catalysts by imitating certain key features of enzymes. To tune the pore structures and modify the functional groups of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), the porosity, functionality and hydrophobic/hydrophilic pore nature of the emerging porous materials are systematically tunable, which endow them to match certain enzymatic features, including structural features, active sites, microenvironments, assistant sites and/or catalytic properties of enzymes. Compared with their enzyme counterparts, biomimetic MOF catalysts present the advantages of broadened applicable conditions and enhanced stability, and sometimes they exhibit catalytic properties that are not possessed by the native enzymes. This review will selectively illustrate biomimetic MOF catalysts, consisting of immobilized biomimetic active sites on the pore surfaces or inside the pore space of porous MOFs. We will discuss the design principles and synthetic strategies for biomimetic MOF catalysts, and the relationships between their catalytic properties and structures. The key roles of active sites, microenvironment, transmission channels and co-catalytic sites, associated with the synergistic catalysis of biomimetic MOFs, will be addressed.},

	abstract = {Cancer cell targeting peptides have emerged as a highly efficient approach for selective delivery of chemotherapeutics and diagnostics to different cancer cells. However, the use of α-peptides in pharmaceutical applications is hindered by their enzymatic degradation and low bioavailability. Starting with a 10-mer α-peptide 18 that we developed previously, here we report three novel analogues of 18 that are proteolytically stable and display better (up to 3.5-fold) affinity profiles for breast cancer cells compared to 18. The design strategy involved replacement of two or three amino acids in the sequence of 18 with D-residues or β 3-amino acids. Such replacement maintained the specificity for cancer cells (MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-231, and MCF-7) with low affinity for control noncancerous cells (MCF-10A and HUVEC), showed an increase in secondary structure, and rendered the analogues completely stable to human serum and liver homogenate from mice. The three analogues are potentially safe with minimal cellular toxicity and are efficient targeting moieties for specific drug delivery to breast cancer cells. The strategy used here may be adapted to develop peptide analogues that will target other cancer cell types.},

	abstract = {The use of peptidomimetics has emerged as a powerful means for overcoming the limitations inherent in the physical characteristics of peptides thus improving their therapeutic potential. A peptidomimetic approach that has emerged in recent years with significant potential, is the use of β-amino acids. β-Amino acids are similar to α-amino acids in that they contain an amino terminus and a carboxyl terminus. However, in β-amino acids two carbon atoms separate these functional termini. β-amino acids, with a specific side chain, can exist as the R or S isomers at either the α (C2) carbon or the β (C3) carbon. This results in a total of 4 possible diastereoisomers for any given side chain. The flexibility to generate a vast range of stereo- and regioisomers, together with the possibility of disubstitution, significantly expands the structural diversity of β-amino acids thereby providing enormous scope for molecular design. The incorporation of β-amino acids has been successful in creating peptidomimetics that not only have potent biological activity, but are also resistant to proteolysis. This article reviews the rapidly expanding applications of β-amino acids in the design of bioactive peptide analogues ranging from receptor agonists and antagonists, MHC-binding peptides, antimicrobial peptides and peptidase inhibitors. Given their structural diversity taken together with the ease of synthesis and incorporation into peptide sequences using standard solid-phase peptide synthesis techniques, β-amino acids have the potential to form a new platform technology for peptidomimetic design and synthesis.},

	abstract = {Peptides based on unnatural beta(3)-amino acids offer a versatile platform for the design of self-assembling nanostructures due to the folding stability of the 14-helix and the high symmetry of the side chains inherent in this geometry. We have previously described that N-terminal acetylation (Ac-) forms a supramolecular self-assembly motif that allows beta(3)-peptides to assemble head-to-tail into a helical nanorod which then further bundles into hierarchical superstructures. Here we investigate the effect of the topography of the 14-helical nanorod on lateral self-assembly. Specifically, we report on the variations in the superstructure of three isomeric peptides comprising the same three beta(3)-amino acid residues: beta(3)-leucine (L), beta(3)-isoleucine (I) beta(3)-alanine (A) to give peptides Ac-beta(3)[LIA], Ac-beta(3)[IAL] and Ac-beta(3)[ALI]. AFM imaging shows markedly different superstructures for the three peptides. Well defined synchrotron far-infrared spectra reveal uniform geometries with a high degree of similarity between the isomeric peptides in the amide modes of the 400-650 wavenumber range. Far-IR also confirms that the C-terminal carboxyl group is free in the assemblies, thus it is solvated in the dispersant. Hence, the differences in the superstructures formed by the fibers are defined primarily by van der Waals energy minimization between the varied cross sectional morphologies of the core nanorods.},

            Bioinspired synthesis offers potential green strategies to build highly complex nanomaterials by utilizing the unique nanostructures, functions, and properties of biomolecules, in which the biomolecular recognition and self-assembly processes play important roles in tailoring the structures and functions of bioinspired materials. Further understanding of biomolecular self-assembly for inspiring the formation and assembly of nanoparticles would promote the design and fabrication of functional nanomaterials for various applications. In this review, we focus on recent advances in bioinspired synthesis and applications of hierarchical nanomaterials based on biomolecular self-assembly. We first discuss biomolecular self-assembly towards biological nanomaterials, in which the mechanisms and ways of biomolecular self-assembly as well as various self-assembled biomolecular nanostructures are demonstrated. Secondly, the bioinspired synthesis strategies including molecule–molecule interaction, molecule–material recognition, molecule-mediated nucleation and growth, and molecule-mediated reduction/oxidation are introduced and discussed. Meanwhile, typical examples and discussions on how biomolecular self-assembly inspires the formation of hierarchical hybrid nanomaterials are presented. Finally, the applications of bioinspired nanomaterials in biofuel cells, light-harvesting systems, batteries, supercapacitors, catalysis, water/air purification, and environmental monitoring are presented and discussed. We believe that this review will be very helpful for readers to understand the self-assembly of biomolecules and the biomimetic/bioinspired strategies for synthesizing hierarchical nanomaterials on the one hand, and on the other hand to design novel materials for extended applications in nanotechnology, materials science, analytical science, and biomedical engineering.},

However, the threedimensional structure of many of these materials remains unknown. To develop structure-based criteria for the design of β3-peptide-based biomaterials with tailored function, we investigated the structure of a tri-β3-peptide nanoassembly by molecular dynamics simulations and X-ray ﬁber diﬀraction analysis. Diﬀraction data was collected from aligned ﬁbrils formed by Ac-β3[LIA] in water and used to inform and validate the model structure. Models with 3-fold radial symmetry resulted in stable ﬁbers with a triple-helical coiled-coil motif and measurable helical pitch and periodicity. The ﬁber models revealed a hydrophobic core and twist along the ﬁber axis arising from a maximization of contacts between hydrophobic groups of adjacent tripeptides on the solvent-exposed ﬁber surface. These atomic structures of macroscale ﬁbers derived from β3-peptide-based materials provide valuable insight into the eﬀects of the geometric placement of the side chains and the inﬂuence of solvent on the core ﬁber structure which is perpetuated in the superstructure morphology.},

	abstract = {Lipid-mimetic metallosurfactant based luminophores are promising candidates for labeling phospholipid membranes without altering their biophysical characteristics. The metallosurfactants studied exhibit high structural and physicochemical similarity to phospholipid molecules, designed to incorporate into the membrane structure without the need for covalent attachment to a lipid molecule. In this work, two lipid-mimetic phosphorescent metal complexes are described: [Ru(bpy)2(dn-bpy)]2+ and [Ir(ppy)2(dn-bpy)]+ where bpy is 2,2′-bipyridine, dn-bpy is 4,4′-dinonyl-2,2′-bipyridine and ppy is 2-phenylpyridine. Apart from being lipid-mimetic in size, shape and physical properties, both complexes exhibit intense photoluminescence and enhanced photostability compared with conventional organic fluorophores, allowing for prolonged observation. Moreover, the large Stokes shift and long luminescence lifetime associated with these complexes make them more suitable for spectroscopic studies. The complexes are easily incorporated into dimyristoil-phosphatidyl-choline (DMPC) liposomes by mixing in the organic solvent phase. DLS reveals the labeled membranes form liposomes of similar size to that of neat DMPC membrane. Synchrotron Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) measurements confirmed that up to 5\% of either complex could be incorporated into DMPC membranes without producing any structural changes in the membrane. Fluorescence microscopy reveals that 0.5\% label content is sufficient for imaging. Atomic Force Microscopic imaging confirms that liposomes of the labeled bilayers on a mica surface can fuse into a flat lamellar membrane that is morphologically identical to neat lipid membranes. These results demonstrate the potential of such lipid-mimetic luminescent metal complexes as a new class of labels for imaging lipid membranes.},

In this review, we present the promotion of the synthesis chemistry in this area and introduce the general methods and the important factor of organic template in the synthesis process. To obtain MOFs with high porosity, three strategies will be introduced. We also discuss how to functionalize the MOFs from two directions: chiral frameworks and frameworks constructed from rare earth metals. The burgeoning area of MOF membranes will also be introduced. Most applications of MOFs are based on their ability to function as hosts. The potential applications including hydrogen storage and methane storage, molecular separation, catalysis, and sensor, are summarized. It is expected that MOFs will provide extraordinary advantages over traditional porous materials and have an important and permanent impact on the future of porous compounds.},

Integrating macrocycles into the MOF architectures not only leads to fundamental signiﬁcance in merging the chemistry of MOFs with supramolecular chemistry, but also brings out novel properties from the hybrid materials obtained. This review summarizes recent developments of macrocycle-based MOFs by dividing them into several categories according to various macrocycles employed as the organic struts, including crown ethers, cyclodextrins, calixarenes, cucurbiturils, pillararenes and other macrocycles. The advantages and disadvantages of different macrocycles as the organic struts for building MOFs are compared and analyzed. In addition, ﬁve main applications currently developed using macrocycle-based MOFs are highlighted, which include (1) molecular recognition and separation, (2) gas adsorption and storage, (3) template synthesis, (4) nonlinear optics, and (5) heterogeneous catalysis.

In the latter two compounds, the fundamental formate modes, active in the Raman spectra, showed splittings when the phase transition temperature was traversed. These low-temperature Raman spectra were interpreted in terms of a P21 space group and prove that the phase transition not only involves an ordering in the orientation of the water molecules, but also displacements of the heavy atoms. Only a limited number of weak translational modes of the water molecules could be identified in the Raman spectra of the copper(II) formate tetrahydrate, and it is not possible therefore to determine exactly how ordering affects the Raman-active lattice modes of these molecules.},

Herein, liquid-phase epitaxy has been employed to grow oriented and uniform SURMOF thin-films of Cu ion and tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) ligand on self-assembled monolayer templates. The SURMOF thin-films of Cu-TCNQ on fluorine doped tin oxide, Au, and polyethyleneterephthalate substrates are realized to be highly hydrophobic exhibiting contact angle of water ≈140°. SURMOF thin-film devices of Cu-TCNQ have been fabricated by employing electron-beam lithography technique. Room-temperature current–voltage (I–V) characteristics consistently showed non-Ohmic semiconductivity in the range of ≈10−5 S cm−1. A remarkable rectification in the electrical conductance of SURMOF thin-film device with rectification factor of ≈100 was achieved upon exposing iodine (I2) vapor at ambient conditions whereas bulk-Cu-TCNQ remains nonrectified. Even, highly hydrophobic surface nature is retained in course of gaining electrical rectification. The unusual rectifying thin-film phenomenon induced by I2 is attributed to structural and electronic reorganization in the SURMOF and the rectification follows standard Shockley diode equation. The here presented results demonstrate a new avenue of research on MOFs where electronic and magnetic properties in particular can be efficiently explored and controlled in SURMOF thin-film device configurations (also mechanically flexible) for various technological applications.},

High-quality thin films of a new coordination network compound bearing a Fe(II)–CN–Cu(I) link were fabricated by IRR and employed for efficient electro-catalysis in the form of oxygen reduction reaction.

These effects are used to control the final molecular assembly in terms of feature geometry and distribution and packing of individual molecules within the features.

	abstract = {The vibrational study of nonanoic acid at 90 K is proposed for explaining the molecular interactions of aliphatic chains involved in several biological systems constituted in part by the oleyl group. In fact, the spectra of the C9 acid should have similarities with the spectrum of the portion between the carboxyl group and the double bond in Z- and E-9-octadecenoic acids. After slow crystallization, nonanoic acid appears as a polymorphic form very close to the C form of saturated even-numbered fatty acids. Splitting of the carboxylic vibrations is characteristic of a strong dimeric interaction and also indicates the presence of two dimers in the crystal. The polymethylene vibrational entity is caused by a "pseudo-paraffin" with a number of carbon atoms twice that of the monomeric species CH3(CH2)7COOH. Moreover, an intense band at 109 cm J is attributed to the LAM1 of a C{\textasciitilde}8 segment. The carboxyl group of the dimer appears equivalent to a C-C bond, the inversion centre being that of the crystal. The subcell structure of the alkyl chains is of the orthorhombic polyethylene type O± with deformations particularly near the carboxyl group. We conclude that the acid crystallizes in the C' form, the hydrogen bond having a length close to 2.60 A.},

Up to about a monolayer coverage, copper is converted to the Cu(I) state and thereafter, as oxygen uptake proceeds, to the Cu(II) state. Silver also initially forms a + 1 oxidation state, but both the magnitude of the line widths of, and the significant absence of satellites associated with the core-level peaks suggest that a diamagnetic Ag(III) oxide rather than Ag(II) is formed upon further oxidation. Gold does not proceed beyond the Au(I) state. The densities of states (as reflected in the HeII spectra) of the three metals offer less guidance as to the conditions or ease of formation of the M(I) oxide overlayers, than the energy differences between the s-band edges and the vacuum level.},

Speciﬁcally, extensive reduction of Cu+2 to Cu+1 at the MOF metal nodes was achieved. Introduction of mixed valence copper sites resulted in signiﬁcant changes in the valence band structure and an increased density of states near the Fermi edge, thereby altering the electronic properties of the copper-based framework. The development of mixedvalence MOFs also allowed tuning of selective adsorbate binding as a function of the UMS oxidation state. The presented studies could signiﬁcantly impact the use of MOFs for heterogeneous catalysis and gas puriﬁcation as well as foreshadow a new avenue for controlling the conductivity of typically insulating MOF materials.},

	abstract = {In this report we review the fundamentals, applications and future tendencies of dynamic atomic force microscopy (AFM) methods. Our focus is on understanding why the changes observed in the dynamic properties of a vibrating tip that interacts with a surface make possible to obtain molecular resolution images of membrane proteins in aqueous solutions or to resolve atomic-scale surface defects in ultra high vacuum (UHV). Our description of the two major dynamic AFM modes, amplitude modulation atomic force microscopy (AM-AFM) and frequency modulation atomic force microscopy (FM-AFM) emphasises their common points without ignoring the differences in experimental set-ups and operating conditions. Those differences are introduced by the different feedback parameters, oscillation amplitude in AM-AFM and frequency shift and excitation amplitude in FM-AFM, used to track the topography and composition of a surface. The theoretical analysis of AM-AFM (also known as tapping-mode) emphasises the coexistence, in many situations of interests, of two stable oscillation states, a low and high amplitude solution. The coexistence of those oscillation states is a consequence of the presence of attractive and repulsive components in the interaction force and their non-linear dependence on the tip–surface separation. We show that key relevant experimental properties such as the lateral resolution, image contrast and sample deformation are highly dependent on the oscillation state chosen to operate the instrument. AM-AFM allows to obtain simultaneous topographic and compositional contrast in heterogeneous samples by recording the phase angle difference between the external excitation and the tip motion (phase imaging). Significant applications of AM-AFM such as high-resolution imaging of biomolecules and polymers, large-scale patterning of silicon surfaces, manipulation of single nanoparticles or the fabrication of single electron devices are also reviewed. FM-AFM (also called non-contact AFM—NC-AFM) has achieved the long-standing goal of true atomic resolution with AFM in UHV. Our analysis starts with a discussion of the relation between frequency shifts and tip–surface interactions, emphasising the ability of perturbation theory to describe the measured frequency shift. We discuss the role of short-range chemical interactions in the atomic contrast, with particular attention to semiconductor and ionic (alkali halides and oxides) surfaces. Also included is a detailed quantitative comparison between theoretical simulations and experiment. Inversion procedures, the determination of the tip–sample interaction from the frequency shift versus distance curves above specific sites, are also reviewed. We finish with a discussion of the optimal range of experimental operation parameters, and the use of damping (excitation amplitude) as a source of atomic contrast, including the possible interpretation in terms of microscopic dissipation mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Adsorption of l-lysine on a Cu(110) surface has been carried out under UHV condition from sublimation of a crystalline phase. The adsorption was characterised by FT-RAIRS, LEED and STM. At room temperature, the adsorption geometry of the lysine molecules varies as a function of the exposure. The low coverage phase sees the molecules adsorbed via the oxygen atoms of the deprotonated carboxylate group and the nitrogen atom of the amino group. Close to saturation monolayer regime, the molecules reorient to be anchored to the surface via one oxygen of a side way tilted carboxylate moiety and the interaction of the N atom of the amino group. When this high coverage phase is annealed up to 425K, the chemical nature and the adsorption geometry stay similar. However, the study of each of these phases by LEED and STM has shown three different two-dimensional adlayers. At room temperature, the low coverage phase exhibits paired chains of molecules growing symmetrically at ±19° of the [001] direction, while the high coverage phase presents a chiral (−2, −2; 5, −1) chiral phase with an overall growth direction parallel to the [−112] direction. Finally, the high coverage phase warmed up to 425K leads to a (3×n) structure, which seems to be a stable intermediate overlayer at this temperature, that gives rise to a (3×2) structure when annealed to 450K. A number of schematic adsorption geometry models are proposed for each phase.},

	abstract = {The C 1 s, N 1 s, and O 1 s core level binding energies (BEs) of the functional groups in amino acids (glycine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, arginine, and histidine) with varied side-chains and cell-binding RGD-based peptides have been determined and characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy with a monochromatic Al Kα source. The zwitterionic nature of the amino acids in the solid state is unequivocally evident from the N 1 s signals of the protonated amine groups and the C 1 s signature of carboxylate groups. Significant adventitious carbon contamination is evident for all samples but can be quantitatively accounted for. No intrinsic differences in the XP spectra are evident between two polymorphs (α and γ) of glycine, indicating that the crystallographic differences have a minor influence on the core level BEs for this system. The two nitrogen centers in the imidazole group of histidine exhibit an N 1 s BE shift that is in line with previously reported data for theophylline and aqueous imidazole solutions, while the nitrogen and carbon chemical shifts reflect the unusual guanidinium chemical environment in arginine. It is shown that the complex envelopes of C 1 s and O 1 s photoemission spectra for short-chain peptides can be analyzed quantitatively by reference to the less complex XP spectra of the constituent amino acids, provided the peptides are of high enough purity. The distinctive N 1 s photoemission from the amide linkages provides an indicator of peptide formation even in the presence of common impurities, and variations in the relative intensities of N 1 s were found to be diagnostic for each of the three peptides investigated (RGD, RGDS, and RGDSC).

	abstract = {Bioinspired fibres and hierarchical nano-materials are based on the self-assembly of organic building blocks such as polypeptides. Confirming the core structure of such materials is often challenging as they lack the long-range order required by crystallographic methods. Far-IR spectroscopy characterizes the vibrational modes of large molecular units. These vibrational modes are very sensitive to angle strain and second order interactions such as hydrogen bonding. As such, far-IR spectra hold information about the secondary structure and interactions of large biomolecules. Here we analyze the far-IR vibrational spectra of fibrous nano-materials based on three isomeric unnatural tripeptides, Ac-β3Leu-β3Ile-β3Ala, Ac-β3Ile-β3Ala-β3Leu, and Ac-β3Ala-β3Leu-β3Ile. These peptides have well described self-assembly characteristics, forming one-dimensional nanorods that impose tight conformational constraints on the constituent molecules. The synchrotron far-IR spectroscopic results were interpreted by using density functional theory (DFT) modelling based vibrational analysis. The sensitivity of the spectra to peptide conformation was assessed by comparing the experimental spectra with DFT predictions. In high dielectric implicit solvent, intramolecular hydrogen-bonding is inhibited and thus the energy minimized peptide structure remains close to the 14-helix folding characteristic of substituted β3-peptides, giving good agreement between the experimental and predicted vibration spectra. In contrast, energy minimization in vacuum alters the peptide conformation leading to intramolecular hydrogen bonds, and hence the predicted vibration spectra do not agree with the experimental data. Therefore, our results demonstrate the ability of far-IR spectroscopy to identify correct structural predictions and thus open the way for using far-IR spectroscopy for the characterization and structural analysis of bioinspired nano-materials and potentially their interactions with surfaces, ionic environments and other biomolecules. Far-IR structural analysis is particularly powerful in case of one- and two-dimensional materials such as fibres, hydrogels and thin layers where standard crystallographic analysis is not available.},

The Yb 3d spectra of Yb2Pt6X15 showed both Yb2+-and Yb3+-derived structures, directly indicating valence fluctuation. The Yb valences of Yb2Pt6Al15 were estimated to be 2.89 +/- 0.01 at 250 K and similar to 2.83 at 20 K, while those of Yb2Pt6Ga15 were similar to 2.34 at 300 K with almost no temperature dependence. With changing X ions fromAl to Ga, the Pt 5d and Pt 4f peaks were shifted to shallower binding energies, and the Yb3+ 4f peaks were shifted to the deeper binding energies. The X dependences of the Yb valence and the Kondo temperature of Yb2Pt6X15 are discussed based on the Yb3+ 4f hole level relative to the Fermi level E-F and Pt-derived density of states at EF.},

Here we report that foldectures, that is, self-assembled molecular architectures of β-peptide foldamers, uniformly align with respect to an applied static magnetic field, and also show instantaneous orientational motion in a dynamic magnetic field. This response is explained by the amplified anisotropy of the diamagnetic susceptibilities as a result of the well-ordered molecular packing of the foldectures. In addition, the motions of foldectures at the microscale can be translated into magnetotactic behaviour at the macroscopic scale in a way reminiscent to that of magnetosomes in magnetotactic bacteria. This study will provide significant inspiration for designing the next generation of biocompatible peptide-based molecular machines with applications in biological systems.},

	abstract = {Electrical conduction is well understood in materials formed from inorganic or organic building blocks, but their combination to produce conductive hybrid frameworks and networks is an emerging and rapidly developing field of research. Self-assembling organic–inorganic compounds offer immense potential for functionalising material properties for a wide scope of applications including solar cells, light emitters, gas sensors and bipolar transparent conductors. The flexibility of combining two distinct material classes into a single solid-state system provides an almost infinite number of chemical and structural possibilities; however, there is currently no systematic approach established for designing new compositions and configurations with targeted electronic or optical properties. We review the current status in the field, in particular, the range of hybrid systems reported to date and the important role of materials modelling in the field. From theoretical arguments, the Mott insulator-to-metal transition should be possible in semiconducting metal–organic frameworks, but has yet to be observed. The question remains as to whether electro-active hybrid materials will evolve from chemical curiosities towards practical applications in the near term.},

	abstract = {A silica optical fiber was imaged using an atomic force microscope (AFM) in both contact and tapping mode. The fiber surface contains fragments of low-modulus, viscoelastic polymer after the coating was mechanically removed. While scanning in the contact mode resulted in tip-induced irreversible damage of the polymer, the tapping mode AFM generated reproducible images of the surface topography. It is shown that tapping mode AFM can reduce the contact force significantly, estimated to be as low as a tenth of a nanonewton, even in ambient conditions. This is facilitated by oscillating the tip (i.e. the cantilever) in the vicinity of the surface with an amplitude of up to ∼ 100 nm, which would eliminate capture of the tip by the surface fluid layer. Since the tip is no longer continuously in contact with the surface, both tip and sample degradations are minimized. The example presented herein demonstrates the utility of the tapping mode AFM; evidence is provided which supports the proposed bonding mechanism at the polymer/silica interface.},

Our study reveals that formation of such crystals is exothermic in nature, i.e. it is an energetically favourable process. The mode of magnetic coupling between the local magnetic moments and hence the overall magnetic moment of the MOF can be tuned by changing the transition metal. Not only the magnetic properties, but also the electronic structure of the MOF can be regulated from half-metal to spin-semiconductor to semimetallic–semiconductor by altering the metal center from Cr to Mn to Fe/Co. Our study also indicates that the change in the ligand structure and its anchoring group is also very effective in tuning the electronic properties of MOFs. The study of transport properties reveals that the half-metallic crystal possesses the maximum value of the spin-filtering efficiency, i.e. 100\%.},
